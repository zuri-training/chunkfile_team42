Team 42 is engaged in building a platform that manipulates files with emphasis on chunking large csv and json files.

# Welcome

Welcome to Splita doc, we are working to create a simple and user friendly platform that splits csv and json files. Below is a short guide to help you through the splitting process.

# Our Solution

Are you running out of storage because your file sizes are too large? Are large files slowing your system  down? Are you looking for a way to solve these problems? Solution: Splita. Splita is a free web platform that lets you split large csv and json files into small sizes we call chunks. The Chunked sizes can be manually selected so that users can set their own chunk size.You can upload files from your local machine or your cloud service provider straight to Splita to start the process.After splitting your files you have a choice to immediately download your chunks or save them to a cloud service provider of your choice (Google Drive,Dropbox or one drive).

Splita is powered by Django framework, HTML, CSS, Javascript and MYSQL. 

Splita is a free web platform,however  to be able to perform all the above ,the platform will require you to Sign up or log in first. Authenticated users will be redirected to a dashboard that lets you split your files as you wish. Unauthenticated users can however go through our landing page and documentation to better understand  the service.
